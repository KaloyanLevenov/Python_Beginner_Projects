    madlib = f"A {adjective_one} glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an edge of \n\
dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest {noun_one}. The light hit both of their {body_part_one} \n\
at the same time, so that Voldemort’s was suddenly a flaming {noun_two}. Harry heard the high voice \n\
shriek as he too {verb_past} his best hope to the heavens, pointing Draco’s {noun_three}:\n\
\"{spell_one}!\"\n\
\"{spell_two}!\"\n\
The bang was like a cannon blast, and the {adjective_two} flames that erupted between them, \n\
at the dead center of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the \n\
{noun_plural} collided. Harry saw Voldemort’s {adjective_three} jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand \n\
fly high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the \n\
head of Nagini, spinning through the air toward the master it would not {verb}, who had \n\
come to take full possession of it at last. And Harry, with the unerring skill of a Seeker, \n\
caught the {noun_four} in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms splayed, the slit pupils \n\
of the {adjective_four} {body_part_two} rolling upward. Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality, his body \n\
feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and unknowing. Voldemort \n\
was dead, {verb_past_two} by his own rebounding {noun_five}, and Harry stood with two wands in his hands, \n\
staring down at his enemy’s {noun_six}."
