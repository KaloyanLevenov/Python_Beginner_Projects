    The journey to becoming a good programmer starts with hope in your mind and dream in your {body_part}. 
    Through blood, sweat, and {noun_plural_one}, hopefully it never ends. Yes, once you learn {verb}, it becomes 
    a part of your life identity and you can become a super {adjective_two}, hacker. 
    Knowledge of programming lets you take control of your {noun_one}. 
    You can create your own personal {noun_plural_two}, anything from developing {adjective_three}, software 
    to analyzing data and making predictions about the {noun_two}. 
    You can maybe even recreate Jarvis and make him extra {adjective_four}. 
    I hope you'll start your {adjective_five} journey by coding :)"""
